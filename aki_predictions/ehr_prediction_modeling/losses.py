    """Returns the task-specific SNR connections.

    If use_task_specific_routing is disabled in both the model and the encoder
    it will return an (empty dictionary, empty list) tuple.

    For sub-network routing when optimizing task specific connections we
    want to optimize each corresponding to the specific task loss they're
    associated with.

    If the model type is not SNRNN and the encoder type is not SNR then this
    function will return empty collections.

    Args:
      model: The instantiated model. Must be an SNRNN in order to have
        any connections returned.
      encoder: The instantiated encoder. Must have SNREncoders associated
        with the embedding in order to have any connections returned.
      losses_per_task: A dictionary from task name to associated total loss for
        that task.

    Returns:
      A tuple where the first element is a dictionary from a task specific loss
      to a variable list that will be optimized wrt to it, and the second element
      is a set of all the routing connections in the architecture.
